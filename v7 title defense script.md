Good afternoon to our dearest panelists and to our fellow students. This is Group 7 of 10 Maxwell presenting our title proposal: Data Analysis and Monitoring of Water Consumption Using Arduino and LoRaWAN

On to the Background of the Study. 

Water is a crucial resource for life and its usage often lacks proper management, leading to waste. This inefficiency not only squanders clean water but also incurs financial costs. However, the advent of Internet of Things technologies presents an opportunity to enhance water management practices. 

While many studies use Arduino for water consumption data collection, few have incorporated LoRaWAN, a low-power, long-range communication technology. LoRa devices can communicate over distances of approximately 3-5 km. The combination of these tools can yield reliable and precise data for analysis. 

The literature regarding the use of technologies that yield analyzable data for insights. This research aims to fill this void by creating a system that uses an Arduino water flow sensor and LoRa & LoRaWAN for data transmission. The data is sent to a web server and presented in a tabular form. This allows users to understand their water usage patterns over time and identify areas of high consumption. Ultimately, the goal is to easily be able to analyze data and through it, manage water consumption better.

Next, we gave the risks and hazards that might happen to the research personel while conducting the study. This study involves a single risk of electrical shock due to the use of water and electronic components. The risk is minor and can be mitigated by deactivating the power supply when handling Arduino components and using rubber gloves during testing. Safety guidelines will be strictly followed throughout the research to ensure the safety of the researchers and the integrity of the study.
