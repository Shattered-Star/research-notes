[Arduino Based Smart Irrigation System and Plant Leaf Disease Detection Using Matlab by D. Rama Prabha, Ram Swaminathan, Kalepu Chaitanya, W. Razia Sultana :: SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3525954)
> It can also help to detect the type of diseases occurring, by analysis of the leaves using Kmeans segmentation algorithm in the MATLAB software. By the use of this system, assistance in the optimum growth of plants is possible, can increase the yield and also lessen the frequency of visit to the fields, enabling the farmer to focus on other agricultural activities
