## Comparisons between our research topic and the paper ["LoRa based Water Management System"](https://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIR1902334.pdf)

#### General Comparison
- Your research and the paper both use LoRa technology for water management, but they have different objectives and applications. Your research focuses on data analysis and monitoring of water consumption using Arduino and LoRaWAN, while the paper aims to design a real-time water quality monitoring system using various sensors, LoRa modules, cloud and web portal.

- Your research and the paper both use Arduino microcontroller and LoRa RF module as the main components of the LoRa module, but they differ in the types of sensors they use. Your research uses a water flow sensor to measure the water consumption, while the paper uses pH, level, flow, turbidity and temperature sensors to measure the water quality.

- Your research and the paper both use cloud to store and process the data received from the LoRa gateway, but they use different platforms and methods. Your research uses Python to receive and manage the data, and ThingSpeak to analyze and visualize the . The paper does not specify the platform or method used for cloud computing, but it mentions that it runs prediction models on the data and triggers alerts in case of any changes in water quality or flow.

- Your research and the paper both use web page to display the results of the data analysis, but they have different features and functionalities. Your research uses a web page to show various things such as expected water bill, trends on water consumption, water outlet analysis, and graphs. The paper uses a web page to show only the water quality parameters and alerts.

#### Positive differences of our research
1. **Specific Focus on Water Consumption**: Your research specifically focuses on monitoring and analyzing water consumption, which is a critical aspect of water management. This focus allows for detailed insights into usage patterns and can help identify areas for potential water savings.
2. **Use of LoRaWAN Technology**: The use of LoRaWAN technology in your research for transmitting data from the Arduino board to the server could potentially offer advantages in terms of long range and low power consumption, making it suitable for IoT applications.
4. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Your research involves comprehensive data analysis and visualization, including calculating expected water bills, identifying trends in water consumption, and analyzing which water outlets consume the most water. This could provide valuable insights for consumers and water management authorities.
6. **Flexibility in Sensor and Board Selection**: Your methodology allows for the potential use of different types of water flow sensors and Arduino boards, providing flexibility depending on specific requirements or constraints.    
5. **Potential for Real-Time Monitoring**: With your system, there is the potential for real-time monitoring of water consumption, which could enable immediate response to any significant changes or anomalies in water usage.

#### Negative differences of our research
1. **Limited Scope**: Your research focuses solely on water consumption, which, while important, is just one aspect of water management. The paper you’re comparing with might have a broader scope, considering other factors like water quality.
2. **Dependence on Hardware**: Your research relies heavily on specific hardware components like the Arduino board and water flow sensors. Any issues with these components (like hardware failure or inaccurate readings) could impact the reliability of your results.
3. **Power Supply**: You’ve mentioned the use of button batteries as a possible power supply. Depending on the frequency of data transmission, these might need frequent replacement, which could be a logistical challenge. 
4. **Data Transmission Frequency**: Your methodology involves transmitting data every 30 seconds. While this provides detailed data, it might also lead to higher power consumption and data storage requirements.
5. **Data Analysis Complexity**: While your research plans to provide detailed insights through data analysis, this could also increase the complexity of your project. Ensuring accurate and meaningful analysis might require sophisticated algorithms and considerable computational resources.
