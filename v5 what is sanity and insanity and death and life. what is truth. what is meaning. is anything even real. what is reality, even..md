# Arduino-Based Assistive Ankle Bracelet for the Visually Impaired
#### Improvements over previous designs:
- much more compact than others
- easier to bring around
- does not require a hand to keep on holding it
- gives more flexibility for the visually impaired in general
#### Challenges:
- height of detection
	- ultrasonic sensors
	- infared sensors
	- LIDAR sensors
	- radar sensors
- range of features
- tactile feedback
	- vibration
	- electro-tactile stimulation
		basically you shock them just a little bit
	- mechanical parts that move and can be felt by the wearer
